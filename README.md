# NETFLIX CLONE
I have created the UI of this Netflix. I started front end development some time back so I am a beginner developer. This is a project of mine which I have made with pure HTML and CSS. Used many concepts of CSS like flex box and grid box. I hope you liked it, if you have any suggestion then you can share. Thank you 🙏🙏
